<p><b><em>Sonnet 130: My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun</em></b><br>
<b><em>BY WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</em></b><br>
<br>
My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;<br>
Coral is far more red than her lips' red;<br>
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;<br>
If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.<br>
I have seen roses damasked, red and white,<br>
But no such roses see I in her cheeks;<br>
And in some perfumes is there more delight<br>
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.<br>
I love to hear her speak, yet well I know<br>
That music hath a far more pleasing sound;<br>
I grant I never saw a goddess go;<br>
My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground.<br>
And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare<br>
As any she belied with false compare.<br>

<b><em>Sonnet 116: Let me not to the marriage of true minds</em></b><br>
<b><em>BY WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</em></b> <br>
<br>
Let me not to the marriage of true minds<br>
Admit impediments. Love is not love<br>
Which alters when it alteration finds,<br>
Or bends with the remover to remove.<br>
O no! it is an ever-fixed mark<br>
That looks on tempests and is never shaken;<br>
It is the star to every wand'ring bark,<br>
Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.<br>
Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks<br>
Within his bending sickle's compass come;<br>
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,<br>
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.<br>
If this be error and upon me prov'd,<br>
I never writ, nor no man ever lov'd.<br>

My heart burns there, too."<br>

<b><em>My Papa's Waltz</em></b><br>
<b><em>BY THEODORE ROETHKE</em></b><br>
<br>
The whiskey on your breath<br>   
Could make a small boy dizzy;<br>
But I hung on like death: <br>  
Such waltzing was not easy.<br>

We romped until the pans <br>  
Slid from the kitchen shelf; <br> 
My mother's countenance  <br> 
Could not unfrown itself. <br>
<br>

The hand that held my wrist  <br> 
Was battered on one knuckle; <br>
At every step you missed   <br>
My right ear scraped a buckle. <br>
<br>

You beat time on my head  <br> 
With a palm caked hard by dirt,  <br> 
Then waltzed me off to bed  <br> 
Still clinging to your shirt. <br>

<b><em>Richard Cory</em></b> <br>
<b><em>BY EDWIN ARLINGTON ROBINSON</em></b><br>
<br>

Whenever Richard Cory went down town,<br>
We people on the pavement looked at him:<br>
He was a gentleman from sole to crown,<br>
Clean favored, and imperially slim.<br>
<br>

And he was always quietly arrayed,<br>
And he was always human when he talked;<br>
But still he fluttered pulses when he said,<br>
"Good-morning," and he glittered when he walked.<br>
<br>

And he was rich-yes, richer than a king-<br>
And admirably schooled in every grace:<br>
In fine, we thought that he was everything<br>
To make us wish that we were in his place.<br>
<br>

So on we worked, and waited for the light,<br>
And went without the meat, and cursed the bread;<br>
And Richard Cory, one calm summer night,<br>
Went home and put a bullet through his head.<br>
</p>
